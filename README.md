# Dotfiles & co

This repo contains my various dotfiles and configurations, meant to be deployed with ansible.

It evolved organically frow various sources, and many elements here are unreasonably complicated, or not considered good practice even by me.

Still, feel free to have a look around !

## Supported operating systems

Currently supported :

* Fedora

Previously supported, should likely still mostly work with minor tweaks (especially installed packages) :

* Ubuntu
* Manjaro (Arch)

Previously partially supported :

* MacOS (cf roles/deploy/tasks/desktop_mac.yml for details)

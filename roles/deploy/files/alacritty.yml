key_bindings:
  # Consistently delete last word with Ctrl-Backspace
  # This is a standard across graphical apps, but terminal apps usually do it with Ctrl-W (Emacs bindings)
  # It at least works with vim, zsh (with my zle config), readline (with my config) (includes bash)
  # Should also work out of the box with these programs since my config pays attention to keep most emacs bindings when switching to vi mode
  # NB : This is the actual Ctrl-W character, not an escape sequence
  - { key: Back, mods: Control, chars: "" }

  # This is an ugly workaround for MacOS
  # cf https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5755
  # Basically, the Alt layer is fucked up, and alacritty sends Alt+char instead of char
  # We hardcode here the parts of the Alt layer that we use as a workaround
  # NB : I'm not sure if this is ignored on Linux or if it's interpreted as Alt, but either way, it doesn't seem to break anything, so...

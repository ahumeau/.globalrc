key_bindings:
  # Consistently delete last word with Ctrl-Backspace
  # This is a standard across graphical apps, but terminal apps usually do it with Ctrl-W (Emacs bindings)
  # It at least works with vim, zsh (with my zle config), readline (with my config) (includes bash)
  # Should also work out of the box with these programs since my config pays attention to keep most emacs bindings when switching to vi mode
  # NB : This is the actual Ctrl-W character, not an escape sequence

# When making changes in this file, make sure to *REBOOT*. Logging out is not always enough (at least with GDM)

# GTK3 & GTK4 theme configuration
# It seems GTK4 (or at least nautilus) cannot be configured through config files in .config
# Since this is the only setting we currently need to change, this should be fine for now
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GTK
# NB : I haven't found yet a way to explicitly configure a theme family, while still
# honoring runtime dark theme switching with org.freedesktop.appearance.color-scheme
# for that reason we remove this for now, and let GTK apps use the default theme.
# TODO : drawback : without this setting, some apps display an ugly white top bar
#   It's possible to add this envvar to their specific invocation, though
# GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark
# GTK_THEME=Adwaita

# Configure theme for Qt5 applications (such as vlc)

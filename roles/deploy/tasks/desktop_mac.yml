# This file is kept for reference, in case I need to work on MacOS again, or just want to refer to it.

# Things that were still TODO when I stopped using a Mac :
#
# General issues that need solving :
# * copy-paste keyboard shortcuts
# * ssh-agent
# * Ctrl-backspace to delete word
#
# Fixed manually, to automate :
# * install brew
#
# Stuff that I found nice on MacOS, and wish I had on Linux
# * Dead keys representation in (almost all) text fields
# * Permission management across the system (popup to allow terminal to access downloads directory...)
# * Per-app notification permissions
# * maybe move rofi to cmd + space (this shortcut is cool)
# * Consistent copy-paste shortcut across everything (including terminal)

# Notes and references on tiling wm and input system :
# * Notes on Apple keyboard layout configuration language (older but still valid, except next point)
#   * https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2056/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003085-CH1-SUBSECTION16
# * Apple keyboard layout configuration language does not allow for differeciated Alt/AltGr keys
#   * https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/431564/keyboard-layout-with-differentiated-option-keys-alt-altgr
# * Please note that (if I remember correctly) ukulele generates config files for that same language, so, same limitations
# * Therefore, we need to use a lower-level workaround. Karabiner-elements seems to be the best option at this point.
#   * I was thinking of adding a Karabiner output format to https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/kalamine. Kaz√© seems OK with it, but haven't done anything yet.
# * skhd might be able to do it too. Unsure.
#
# * For a tiling wm, https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai seems to be the best solution. A bit hacky but mostly works so far.
#   * Maybe https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst, otherwise
